#  Random-User -Generator -using -API
In this project, I built a simple Python script that uses the Random User API to fetch and display random user data. The goal was to practice working with APIs, JSON data parsing, and Python control structures such as loops.  Key Features:   Utilized the requests library to send GET requests to the API. Parsed the API response using the json() method to extract structured data. Implemented for loops to display multiple random users and access nested data like name, location, email, and profile pictures. Focused on understanding how to work with external data sources and handle JSON objects in Python.  Python (requests, json, loops, data structures) API Integration (GET requests, response handling)   Data Parsing and FormattingError Handling (optional if added)
